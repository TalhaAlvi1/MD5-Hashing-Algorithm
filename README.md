# Objective
MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value. It is commonly used to verify data integrity.
# Algorithm
**1. Initialize MD5 state variables:**
   - Four 32-bit variables (A, B, C, D) are initialized with predefined constants.

**2. Pre-processing:**
   - Append padding bits to the message such that the length is congruent to 448 modulo 512.
   - Append the original message length as a 64-bit integer.

**3. Process the message in 512-bit blocks:**
   - Divide the message into blocks of 512 bits each.
   - For each block, perform the following steps:
       a. Divide the block into 16 words of 32 bits each.
       b. Perform a series of 64 operations, grouped into four rounds, using bitwise operations and modular addition.

**4. Output:**
   - Concatenate the variables (A, B, C, D) to form the final 128-bit hash value.

# Explanation
MD5 is designed to take an input message of arbitrary length and produce a fixed-length hash value. It is commonly represented as a 32-character hexadecimal number. MD5 is fast and simple but is no longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities to collision attacks. However, it is still used for checksums and basic data integrity verification.
